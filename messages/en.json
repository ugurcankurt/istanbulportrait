        "answer": "I offer sessions at premium rooftop venues with stunning Bosphorus views, historic areas like Sultanahmet (Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia), Galata Tower surroundings, Ortaköy Mosque, and hidden gems throughout the city. Each location is chosen for its unique character and photogenic qualities."
      },
      "session-duration": {

        "question": "What's the best time of day for Istanbul photoshoots?",
        "answer": "Golden hour (1 hour before sunset) provides the most flattering light and stunning city views. For rooftop sessions, sunset timing offers magical Bosphorus reflections. Morning sessions (8-10 AM) are perfect for fewer crowds at historic locations."

        "question": "How far in advance should I book my Istanbul photoshoot?",

      },
      "cost-breakdown": {
        "question": "What does Istanbul photography session cost include?",
